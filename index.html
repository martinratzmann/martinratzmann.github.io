    <h1>About</h1>
<p>As a social scientist, I study individual and structural aspects of social, economic, and political decision-making. I hold a degree in Psychology from the University of Greifswald and earned my doctorate at the University of Bayreuth in Strategic Management and Organization on the topic of innovation capacity in the context of demographic change. Afterwards, I spent some time there conducting research and teaching. In my work, I have used SPSS, Mplus, SmartPLS, R, and Python.</p>
<p>Today, I primarily use R and Python to analyze data and to develop models for forecasting and causal analysis. Increasingly, I apply methods of qualitative and quantitative linguistic text analysis, machine learning, neural networks, and large language models.</p>
<p>This website contains teaching materials and code from courses I taught and projects I contributed to. Since then, environments have changed and new tools emerged. The scripts reflect perspectives and pragmatic attempts from different stages of my work. Much has evolved, but some parts may still be useful.</p>
